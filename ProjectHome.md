Version 1.5.1 has been published. It includes new concepts for Forms L & R which may replace Forms A, B, and C for future CIVA events. Contest organisers are encouraged to try them out.

---

_december 26, 2014_

Christmas present! OpenAero 1.5.0 is out!

A lot of new features and some bug fixes are in this version, but the most important is the new **Free Unknown Designer**. This makes it much easier and quicker to design a good Free Unknown sequence from a provided set of Free Unknown figures. Information on it's use can be found in the OpenAero manual.

Also included in this version are CIVA and national rules and sequences for 2015.

As always, please report any bugs or other issues with the use of OpenAero at [the issues page](https://code.google.com/p/open-aero/issues/list).

Happy new aerobatic year!

Version 1.4.5 released.

A very annoying bug, introduced in 1.4.4, that caused sequence file opening to be disabled on some Windows machines has been solved.

Also, the automatic figure separating has been greatly improved. A new option (enabled by default) to keep new or changed figures separated from others is now also available.

---

_september 24, 2014_

As of today, the New Zealand Aerobatic Club rules are implemented in OpenAero.

Version 1.4.4 also includes several improvements for tablet use. On iPad, unfortunately Safari may crash when using OpenAero. So please use the Google Chrome browser, available on the App Store.

_september 28, 2013_

In less than two weeks the [WAC](http://http://wac2013.com/) will start. Some OpenAero bugs were reported impacting Unlimited, and OpenAero 1.4.0 is not yet ready. So another intermediate version 1.3.8 is out now solving those bugs and adding some new features.

Expect version 1.4.0 after the CIVA rules for 2014 have been decided on at the CIVA meeting in november.

_july 27, 2013_

OpenAero 1.3.7, with some bug fixes and new functions, has been published.

---

_july 16, 2013_

Added quick bugfix for Glider Super Slow Rolls Aresti number to version 1.3.6.

---

_july 5, 2013_

Version 1.3.6 released. Another bug fix update with fixed figure definitions for 8.6.18.x and 8.6.19.x and other small improvements. Version 1.4.0 with many enhancements will probably not be out before the end of the European competition season.

---

_june 29, 2013_

A new update, quicker than expected...

A bug in version 1.3.4 caused rule checking for specific rolls on figures (e.g. no roll in top of reverse P for Advanced Unknown) to be disabled. This bug has been fixed in the new version 1.3.5, out today.

---

_june 28, 2013_

OpenAero 1.3.4 has been released with some new features and again many small bug fixes.

Some of the new goodies are:
  * saving of all figures in a sequence as separate images in a single zip file
  * automatic a/c registration parsing for IAC Forms
  * country flags in Grid view
  * improved figure selection in the sequence

Next version will be 1.4.0 which will have many more settings options and multilingual support.

**OpenAero 1.3.3 is out!**

With special thanks to all those who have offered their support by testing OpenAero, writing code and giving helpful suggestions.

There are many new features of which the improved figure chooser will stand out most for anyone creating sequences.

Check out the improved [manual](http://openaero.net/manual.html) for help on getting started or improving your OpenAero skills.

_may 18, 2013_

Found an annoying bug for Y-to-Y axis 180 degree turns (e.g. "h4 2j2").

The direction was inconsistent on Form B and C. New OpenAero version 1.3.1 fixes this.

---

_may 17, 2013_

Version 1.3.0 is out and offers many improvements and new features.

Some of these are improved form handling, availability of a figure queue for sequence design, better sequence checking etc...

Please check the [Changelog](https://code.google.com/p/open-aero/source/browse/changelog.txt) for more information.

_march 22, 2013_

Version 1.2.4 is out and fixes several bugs. Figure direction logic is improved and identical to OLAN in most cases. In those cases where the logic is different, OpenAero will automatically change the figure string when opening an OLAN file.

---

_march 7, 2013_

A new major release for OpenAero, version 1.2.3!

Many new features, including drawing logic that is practically identical to OLAN. This does mean that sequences made in previous versions of OpenAero need to be checked for correct exit directions of figures.

Updates include full glider support and the ability to enter comments before figures.

Another improvement is that it is now possible to use OpenAero offline without downloading. When visiting www.openaero.net the software will automatically be installed in your browser for offline use.

---

_januari 11, 2013_

Some major bugs were found in version 1.2.1. Version 1.2.2 which is now available solves these.

---

_januari 8, 2013_

Added layout for mobile phones and several new graphical editing options.

---

_december 12, 2012_

**Full graphical sequence composition and new 2013 figures now available**

OpenAero should provide all you need for the 2013 power sequences. For glider some updates should be added but are expected soon.

---

_november 16, 2012_

**Graphical figure selection is active!**

Just the base figures for now, but expect roll selection, line length modification etc. in the near future.

---

_november 13, 2012_

A lot of bugfixes and additions this time. Everybody is urgently advised to upgrade

---

_october 19, 2012_

Added new 'sequence' menu with several options for sequence editing

Drag & drop figure repositioning now avaliable

_august 26, 2012_

Sequence validity checking is now available for CIVA Advanced & Unlimited and BAeA/VINK Intermediate.

We could use help with coding new features and resolving bugs. This software is open source in the hope that other programmers in the aerobatic community will also be contributing to making it better.
