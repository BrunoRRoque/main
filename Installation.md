# Introduction #

OpenAero does not need traditional installation and can be used on many different devices and operating systems.

# Details #

The best supported browser is [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) which is available for Windows, OSX, Linux, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/chrome/id535886823) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome). Other modern browsers may also run OpenAero, however there are some known issues with Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari browsers.

There are two ways of using OpenAero; online and offline.

# Online use #

Go to [openaero.net](http://openaero.net) and you immediately have access to the latest version of OpenAero.

# Offline use #

As of version 1.2.3 it is usually not necessary (and not recommended) to separately download OpenAero. It will be automatically installed in your browser and available for offline use whenever you visit [www.openaero.net](http://www.openaero.net). This will also ensure you always have the latest version.

If you do want to download OpenAero separately:
  * download OpenAero as a single ZIP file from [Browse Source](https://code.google.com/p/open-aero/source/browse/)
  * unzip the ZIP file to a location of your choice. As an example we will use "My Documents" (Windows)
  * Open the openaero folder in My Documents
  * If you have Google Chrome as your default browser, just click OpenAero.html
  * If you have another browser as your default, right-click OpenAero.html and choose "Open with Google Chrome"
  * You can now create a bookmark/link for OpenAero in your browser

# Offline use on your own webserver #

When running OpenAero in your own webserver saving files is more convenient. Follow the instructions above but unzip the folder to a location in your webserver's html directory. Your webserver must support PHP.
You can now use OpenAero from http://localhost/your/path

# Installation and usage problems #

If you encounter any problems please do not hesitate to:
  * check the [Known issues](http://code.google.com/p/open-aero/issues/list)
  * add a new issue when your problem/request is not present

OpenAero is under full development. Expect many more features in the near future!
