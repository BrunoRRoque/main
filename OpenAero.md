OpenAero is aerobatic sequence design software available from http://openaero.net that runs inside your web browser. This makes it available on practically any computer, tablet and even Smartphone. For the best experience the Google Chrome web browser is recommended, and currently Mozilla Firefox also works well. Other web browsers may offer sufficient W3C standards compatibility to function correctly, but not all. It is useful to set the full-screen browser mode (usually by pressing F11 on your keyboard) to have the maximum screen space available when using OpenAero.

The latest version of the software is always presented when you are online, and will be installed automatically. Once you have visted openaero.net your current version of the software will also be available to you when you are offline. For tablets and Smartphones it will help to click View ... Mobile version and the layout will be adjusted to fit the narrower screen format.

Even though no other software besides OpenAero is necessary to produce complete and valid aerobatic sequences, the ready availability of an official and current copy of the relevant power or glider Aresti catalog is recommended for checking.
